  <h1 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;" >Aims</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">The aim of this project is to create a game that gives the player an immersive experience of what a fantasy world would be like. More importantly, it is not just about fighting monsters or exploring dungeons. Players are also able to experience doing things that are found in real life such as owning estate property, building relationships, having a non-adventurous job such as being a retailer, politician, miner, hunter, etc. Many things that can be done in real life will be replicated and modified to fit a fantasy world. More than that, the world will be built to be massive for players to experience and explore.</p>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">However, due to the possible limitations such as time constrictions or resources running out, we will have to limit many of the major aspects we want to implement on this game for the demo but keep the core parts of the game such as the world and basic gameplay to save time. Other resources or items and aspects such as monster, dungeons, or core job systems will be delayed in development. Right now, the priority is to create a good demo of a game and leaving any further parts of what we've envisioned for future updates to the game's development.</p>
