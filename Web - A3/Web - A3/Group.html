  <h2 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;" >Group Reflection</h2>
  <h1 style="color: green;font-size:20px;">EJ Reflection:</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:15px;">I didn't know anyone in this class and had to rely on our Professor to group us together. When asked if there was anything specific, I asked to be grouped with people who liked games as well. So here we are. Simon, Long, and Jerin. I didn't know any of them at all and I was nervous because I tend to be shy around new people. It does help that we were working online, but it would have been nice to meet them in person. They were pretty cool people and despite being packed with so much work the past two weeks and having a slow start with our group, we managed to properly divide our work and discuss what we wanted to discuss clearly in each meeting. Everything that needed to be addressed was properly dealt with and everyone did their part on time. We didn't know each other well but we managed to pull off working together like a team and I like them. I just wish I could get to know them a little better and in better circumstances because online classes are not optimal compared to actually meeting face to face. Hopefully, we continue to work well together as the next assignments roll up.</p>
  <h1 style="color: black;font-size:20px;">Long Reflection:</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:15px;">At first, everyone has different perspectives and opinions but in the end, we managed to put our heads together and finalized our report beautifully. Since we agreed to each other's contribution easily there is nothing more I could ask for, if it is I would say that our technical and design concept since we lack experience is so obvious but I wished we could do it better. The most surprising thing was how well we are connected to each other. Everyone was nice. There wasn't any argument that happened. We were all good in our aspect and we all respect each other for it. What I have learned is team communication, how to talk in a group project, voice up your ideas, or think about something. And we did great on every meeting with the average of 40 mins per meeting</p>
  <h1 style="color: red;font-size:20px;">Jerin Reflection:</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:15px;">I Thought our group performed well and better than I expected. EJ, Long and Simon were all easy to get along with and there were never any major disagreements or issues. I think it helped that I had talked to EJ a bit prior to this assignment and had worked with Simon on another assignment. In addition it was a big plus that we all had interests in gaming and our ideal jobs were all based within the gaming Industry as that gave us some common ground. I think our group meetings were done well, as it gave a clear representation of where we were at and what had to be done. Personally, I think my communication skills need to improve as I noticed I talked the least in the group and was quite ineffective in conveying my ideas. What i found most surprising, i suppose, was the amount of people doing this course who are also interested in a career in games programming/development which has made me more confident about doing this course. I think one thing I've learned is that it is important to start group assignments ASAP to avoid getting bogged down with other assignments.</p>
  <h1 style="color: purple;font-size:20px;">Simon Reflection:</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:15px;">Working as a team, it was easy to understand each other's roles and what we were supposed to do individually. I didn’t know anyone in the team, so it was very nice to see everyone take the initiative and introduce each other. Even though we worked together and everyone did their part, I think that there was not enough communication. In calls there was a lack of direction with the assignment, but as it is the first time working in a group it can’t be helped. One thing that was surprising is the way everyone opened up to each other after a while. As a team I learned that even though it is easy to let other people do your work, you should always try to do your part and not let everyone down by being lazy. At the start, Long was shy and quiet, but as the days went by and we talked as a team he started to become more active in the project. Ernest was active from the beginning, helping the team with a positive attitude and was a big help. Jerin was quiet all the time in the call and I don’t even know what he did lmao.</p>
