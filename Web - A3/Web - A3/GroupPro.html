  <h1 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;" >Group processes and communications</h1>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">The contract for communication for the group will be to have a group meeting at least once a week, ideally, we would like to meet twice a week but given there are multiple assignments outside of Intro to IT that all of us have to worry about, it would be difficult. These meetings will be held on Microsoft teams as it is simple to record and since the current pandemic restricts all communication to be conducted online. Other communications between members will also be done online, primarily through texts in Microsoft Teams or Discord as we are all familiar with them and the texts will be recorded if we need to view them later. As this is the primary method of communication, it would be done multiple times a week to give each other updates and assist each other. The minimum expected of all members is that they attend one meeting each week and is active in group chats (has communicated with members at least 3 times a week). If a member is inactive or is not responding to group members for more than a week, we will politely remind them or if that fails, we will inform the tutor.</p>
