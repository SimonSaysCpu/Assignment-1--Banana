  <h1 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;" >Plans and Progress</h1>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">From the start of our first assignment together, we all knew that we wanted to make a video game together. As we did not know people in the class, we were asked what we were interested in before being assigned in groups. Because we had just met, we didn’t really know much about each other or what to do since we’d have to have an idea we’d have to agree on. It did not help that during the time our groups were created and conceptualization had started, we had to focus on other homework that were much more difficult and had earlier deadlines. Thus, we didn’t have another meeting for at least a week or two after we managed to get the rest of our work out of the way. When we did finally meet, we had to come up with a concept if we wanted to move forward to what we wanted to do with our project. So first, we talked about what kind of games we were into. Because we had rather different tastes, we couldn’t really come up with one yet until our tutorial professor suggested that we mix elements of our project ideas together and we ended up with the first version our project would be. It was a mishmash of different game elements found from the puzzle, adventure, RPG, and historical games. But one without a coherent plot yet. But having an idea wasn’t enough yet. First, we had to get the small stuff out of the way.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">We had started working on the info that the assignment asked for, such as our team profile, Industry Data, and others. When we had finally agreed on a time to discuss our project, Long suggested we make an Open-World RPG game that would let the player do whatever they want. The group quickly agreed to the idea and began working on the project idea section. There was no real plan at the moment of conceptualization as the project at the time had no lore behind it nor it had any specific goal. The first thing that our group decided to talk about when considering this project was actual gameplay mechanics that would be incorporated into this project.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">As it goes, what was agreed on at first was an open-world game that does not force the player to follow a specific role. Instead, they can choose what they want to do, take whatever jobs they wish to do, and explore at their own pace. A crafting system was suggested to help players find importance in collecting materials to create their own things.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">However, we knew this kind of game would draw a comparison from previous games that accomplishes much of what our project already does, so the dilemma at the time was to find ways to make our games unique in comparison. EJ suggested a friendship system that aims to innovate NPCs to become more than just faceless quest givers or AI scripted lines. The suggested system would have the NPCs become more dynamic than that of what you find in every other game and lets you befriend them earn benefits from them. The goal was to ensure that these NPCs would seem like real people you would befriend. Games that could be compared to have this system would be Stardew Valley, a game where you can earn a person’s friendship. Having been able to talk about the gameplay, we were ready to submit this assignment. There was no name for the project and a placeholder for the title was Project X.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">After submission, the team would focus their attention at the next set of homework that the class were given to accomplish for other subjects. In between this period to the next assignment for Intro to IT, Long continued to work on the development of the demo with Unity and Blender, occasionally asking for advice or help from his group mates. Unfortunately, we hit a roadblock again after the assignment details for Assignment 3 had been given. Without enough time to meet up and stressed out by the upcoming deadline for Programming and Database assignments, the team agreed to talk about what they can during Tutorials we had with Ivan and continue once the loaded week was over. We first discussed about what our game lacked.  A premise.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">The main goal of our game, as we have said, is to give the player absolute freedom about what they decided to do and what path they may take to follow. However, without any significant lore implemented to what we already have, our game was simply a sandbox game that would most likely be compared to Minecraft or Terraria. We needed something to make the game stand out on its own. We scheduled meetings with Doctor B and were told that we needed to show people what made our game special and find a way to intrigue non-gamers with what we have. For the next couple of weeks, using what time we had, we divided the tasks that we had to finish the job.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">First, we went over the rubrics and comments of what we got from Assignment 2. Taking what we had there and what was asked to be improved, we all took part in fixing the details that were needed for Team Profile and adjust any data we had on the Project Idea.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Due to the bulky nature of the project, we had two of our group members handle further sections of the Overview first. Then, Long and EJ discussed the game’s premise and other significant gameplay features that were to be implemented in the game before running it by the team</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">The title was the very first thing they decided to talk about. They wanted it to sound cool but simple. Many different ideas were thrown around, but the concept that stuck was the idea of living another life or entering another universe from your own. They decided on Rebirth, as it’s as if the developers are telling the users have undergone a rebirth as they enter the area. Due to the limitations of time and hardware that we currently have, the team can only go so far as to make a Demo of the first town and with many other limitations. The demo will be called Rebirth: The Hollows of Aster, following the premise of the first town of Aster. Once the title was out of the way, the actual story outlining was discussed. Firstly, since the demo would only cover the first town, only the town’s lore was discussed in better detail. Take note that there may be changes to this story and the game’s entire story as a whole, but the discussed storyline would go as follows. The Town of Aster is one that celebrates the theme of Spirits, using the long heard rumours of Aster having ghosts as a tourist idea. But deep within the happy town’s façade lies a secret regarding the forbidden areas of Aster. The player is under no circumstances obliged to actually do it immediately. Instead, the game will drop hints that there is something wrong with this town and encourage the player to investigate. Beyond this story, Rebirth’s premise centres around a world with many different towns scattered across its regions and many dungeons are hidden and encompassing the ways to other towns or cities. Players are encouraged to explore and discover the towns for themselves and find the secrets that each of them holds. At the moment, this is as far as the actual story for it goes. Everything being developed beyond that are on the technological side of things and group discussions on what to do with the assignment.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">The HTML will once again mainly be developed by Long while the team assists him in design and editing the site. EJ organizes the data that they currently hold and assigns tasks that the team does equally. Anything that seems out of place is looked at by Simon and Jerin, reporting to Long if there is a need to fix anything at all. At the moment, it is uncertain what this project’s future holds. But there have been discussions of where the game could be taken beyond this assignment. Long, the lead developer will continue this project and has asked help from members of the team as well as planning out which areas he needs to vastly improve on. At the moment, Long is currently learning how to use Unity and Blender to continue developing what has already been accomplished. Those he has asked for help and has offered him their help and support has also taken time to look at this hardware to help him create models that would be hard to make on their own. Further developments on the game’s actual story and gameplay are constant. Eventually, a full team with many different skillsets is being considered for the future to ensure that details beyond maps, models, and lore can be expanded on and ironed out. For example, there are currently no members in the team that can help with sounds, game art, or other technical issues that need to be addressed. In the future, once the game has been thoroughly developed, the team would like to use this as an opportunity to enter the industry and find proper funding to fully developed and help make a name for the team that finished this project. But beyond these ambitions, we as a team understand that there is still much to learn and understand. As freshmen IT students, we are all relatively new to this industry and we still have ways to go before we can even envision ourselves entering the path that companies that have created video games that we love. There’s a lot of programming that we need to learn still and a very large amount of creativity needed to ensure that these games to make a mark on the gaming world. Not only that, we feel as if we still need to learn and improve as a team. As a group of four, getting to know each other first and use what the limited resources that we currently possess will not get us very far. This is still just a budding team. We will still grow, not only in numbers but individually as future programmers in the technological world. And because we are growing, we need to be able to learn how to grow together and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses before getting anything done. After all, everything is easier if you’ve got a team you can trust to support you and help you all the way. Our team has been able to at least work well together and agree on what to do without many creative differences getting in the way or anyone having their egos bruised.</p>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Beyond the assignment, all we can do right now is to continue learning and dream big. Believe in ourselves that we will make it through this course and learn. If we can keep dreaming and continue without any of our willpower shaking, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. The best thing to help you get farther in life besides skill is the resolve to see everything through. And as young students, we still have the time and resolve to keep going no matter what we have to face to ensure our ambitions are met. For now, everything that has been laid in motion is our plans for this assignment. Nothing too crazy just yet, but we hope that by the time that we present our project’s demo, we will find ourselves continuing to work together and see this project completely come to life. Not just for us, but for all the people in the world. We want everyone to see the talent and creativity we have and to enjoy the world we have built together during this challenging first semester here in the University of RMIT. This is just the start of everything.</p>
