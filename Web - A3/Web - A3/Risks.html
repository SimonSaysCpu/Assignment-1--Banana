  <h1 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;">Risks</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">As a video game project being done by a group of students who all love video games, there are many risks that may happen during the course of its creation. First up, our team is using Unity to create the demo. Unity requires models that can either be purchased for use or by creating something by yourself using the Blender app. There will be not a lot of originality using pre-made models nor will it be kind to our wallets. However, creating models using Blender takes quite some time to do and a lot of patience to learn. Since it's also a creative project, we run the risk of having creative differences in our team. We all love video games but we all have different tastes. Many creative projects stumble upon roadblocks simply because the team cannot agree on what to do with certain aspects of the game. Eventually, it can lead to fallouts and other team members may leave. Making it difficult for those that stay behind to continue without the extra manpower. At the moment, the game's demo can be created with very little resources besides time spent. However, should this project push through, a larger budget may eventually be needed and finding funding for this may prove a challenge. It should also be noted that if technology makes more advancements in the future, we run the risk of creating a game that is outdated and far from the ideal version of our project.</p>
