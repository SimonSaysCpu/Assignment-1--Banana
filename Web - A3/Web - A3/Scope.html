    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">The demo for our project will be created using Unity and Blender. Using Unity, we are able to create environments and maps while utilizing assets obtained from the Unity site or those that are created with Blender to initialize the groundwork for our game.
      Due to time constraints and limitations in our skillset, the scope of our project's demo will only cover a small map with possibly up to 3 environments ready for it. The starting town will be the main part. In it will be NPCs that are non-interactable at the moment. There will also be a jungle with a few animals roaming around. And possibly a 90% functional dungeon with hostile monsters that will readily attack you. The character will not be customizable yet for this demo and will have normal stats to allow them to fight back. Cut content from the project's idea as a whole to accommodate the demo's size will be the crafting system, intricate NPC system, character customization, and much of the game's world map as a whole. The estimated run time of the demo will be 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
