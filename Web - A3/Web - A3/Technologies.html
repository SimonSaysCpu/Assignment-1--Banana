    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Game Engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine 4 and that is mostly required to make a decent game currently for this project Unity 2019.3.12f1 is being used to develop this project. In the beginning the game will be using models and assets from many resources like Unity Asset Store, etc. One of the reason is when the game is on early stage we want to focus on the back-end of the game like game systems, mechanic, feature at best possible, we don't want to bother on the front-end design yet. However, later on Blender 2.8 which is a 3D modelling software will be required to develop unique aspect of the game replacing public asset on the internet that were using as placeholders in the back-end stage of the game such as environments, objects. Moving on to the hardware, a decent desktop or laptop that has a powerful heavily graphic handling is required in order to compile and render the game. As a person who is holding a lead developer for the group Long is the one has most experience using them.</p>
