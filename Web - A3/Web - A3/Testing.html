  <h1 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;" >Testing</h1>
    <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Testing is important during a game development since I must make sure that my code is working properly so after a new feature has been added I always play the game and test that feature to see if its working or collapse with something to debug it. Then, when a game has enough features to represent our ideas, we will have an internal test within our group a few days to find any potential bugs. Finally, if we satisfied with it an alpha test will be published to other people outside our groups such as our friend's families, tutors in order to get more feedback from different aspect as much as possible to change or improve if necessary before a public beta test, since we have to make sure the UI the game mechanics is at best condition before the social experience our project. Since the public or beta version will be nearly the same with the final version with some minor changes. At the public beta stage to attract people playing, this project will be advertising on many social media that has gaming groups/Communities including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. There is no limit of people in this stage the more users the more feedback will be received to improve the project.</p>
