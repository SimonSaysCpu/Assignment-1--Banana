  <h1 style="color: blue;font-size:30px;" >Overview</h1>
  <h1 style="color: black;font-size:20px;">Topic</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Our proposed game uses a mix of many traditional and modern RPG mechanics into one. Our project aims to allow the user a great deal of freedom and choose their own desired path instead of following a linear quest path. We want our users to greatly immerse themselves and believe that their character is their own. There is no actual lore for them and everything they do is to build their own character and way of thinking.</p>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Many games innovate from creating a grand story or pulling players in with strong gameplay. We want players to enjoy the gameplay while creating their own little stories, finding many little secrets hidden around the world. Everything is aimed at having the ultimate immersive experience.</p>
  <h1 style="color: black;font-size:20px;">Motivation</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">As gamers, our group was solely interested in being involved with creating a video game project. The world is in such a technologically advanced stage that video games have broken past previous limitations that were once imposed upon them. But because many aspire to create their own world and story like us, our goal is to innovate what already exists in the video game world and expand it into our own. Video games are meant to immerse a player and test their imagination and creativity. We want our game to feel so immersive that the player would feel like they really were inside it. Accomplishing this would show our employers how far we’re willing to get to enter the industry and show them our abilities.</p>
  <h1 style="color: black;font-size:20px;">Landscape</h1>
  <p style="color: black;font-size:18px;">Our game takes a variety of different functions found in different games. Set in an open world like Skyrim, able to do as they please like Fallout, have a building and crafting system like Minecraft, and an expansive NPC system like Stardew Valley or Radiata Stories. But what they’ve already done, we plan to not just apply. We also intend to add in our own creative mix into it. Many games have open worlds and great building systems but neglect to give many of their NPCs anything besides a personality and a specific AI. Our game aims to boost that and create a system where NPCs are not faceless and all provide a great deal of value for the player when they get to know them and treat them like people instead of just doing their questlines and forgetting they exist. We want to make a system where the player really does feel like they’ve made friends.</p>
